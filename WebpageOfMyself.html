<p class="solid"> This is where I lived in the neighbourhood at <a href="https://cityofbogocebu.gov.ph/la-purisima-concepcion/">Brgy. LPC</a>, my second hometown. I used to live at <a href="http://sanremigio.gov.ph/">Municipality of San Remigio</a> when our house got devasted by a typhoon and we move to <a href=" https://cityofbogocebu.gov.ph/">Bogo City</a>, then live at the house of my grandparents. </p>

<p class="solid"> The neighbourhood here is very friendly and well mannered as well. The place is cautious and prepared for any environmental incidents such as flood, earthquake, typhoon, and house fire. There are also events as well such as the festival of Brgy. LPC held on Nov. 29 to Dec. 08 which is the last. Sport and Dance event is also included.</p>

<p class="solid"> Although, traffic may occured at a time where people pay their electric bills at the CEBECO which is close to my home, the flow of the traffic is smooth and no such stuck and packed in the road. </p>
